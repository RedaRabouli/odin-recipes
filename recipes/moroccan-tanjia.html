      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The tanjia is a cherished traditional Moroccan dish that originated in
        Marrakech, particularly among working men who would prepare it before
        heading to work. Named after the tall, urn-shaped earthenware pot in
        which it's cooked, tanjia consists of tender meat (typically lamb or
        beef) slow-cooked with preserved lemons, garlic, cumin, saffron, and
        other aromatic spices. The unique cooking process involves placing the
        sealed pot in the hot ashes of a hammam's (public bathhouse) furnace,
        where it slow-cooks for up to eight hours until the meat becomes
        incredibly tender and infused with the rich flavors of the spices.

        What makes tanjia particularly special is its cultural significance and
        cooking method, which differs from other Moroccan stews like tagine. The
        dish was traditionally prepared by bachelor workers who would assemble
        the ingredients in the morning, take the pot to the hammam's furnace
        keeper (farnatchi), and retrieve their perfectly cooked meal after work.
        The slow cooking process in the furnace's ashes, combined with the
        unique blend of spices and the earthenware pot's properties, creates a
        deep, complex flavor profile that sets tanjia apart from other Moroccan
        dishes. The meat becomes so tender it practically falls apart, while the
        preserved lemons and spices create a rich, satisfying sauce that's
        perfect for soaking up with fresh Moroccan bread.
